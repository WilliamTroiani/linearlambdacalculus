Read me:

The two programs linearlambdacalc and linearlambdacalcdisplay together can
be used to display a deduction tree for any linear lambda term (as per the
paper '[N. Benton, G. Bierman, V. de Paiva, M. Hyland] A Term Calculus for
Intuitionistic Linear Logic').

The program linearlambdacalc turns a given linear lambda term which can be
copy and pasted into a section of the program linearlambdacalcdisplay which
in turn displays the tree in a pretty format.

Instructions:
Open the file linearlambdacalc. At the bottom of the document you will see:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T1 = syntax_tree('(copy derelict((lx.x)) as y, x in z)')

# beloved Church numeral 2
T2 = syntax_tree('(lq.(copy q as h, g in (lz.(derelict(g)(derelict(h)z)))))')

# binary sequence 001
T3 = syntax_tree('(lq.(lp.(copy q as r, s in (lz.(derelict(p)(derelict(s)(derelict(r)z)))))))')

print(construct_d3tree(T1,'null'))
print(construct_d3tree(T2,'null'))
print(construct_d3tree(T3,'null'))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace any of T1, T2, or T3 with the linear lambda term you wish to see the
deduction tree of. Please note:
- the term must be a string (eg: x will not be accepted, but 'x' will),
- the term must be enclosed in brackets according to the appropriate conventions.
Eg, variables do not need to be surrounded in brackets, but almost everything
else does.
- the letter 'l' is being used in place of lambda.

Once this has been done, run the program and you will receive three (most likely
long) arrays. Highlight ONE of these and press copy, then open the document
linearlambdacalcdisplay.

Scroll down until you see the comment:

// *** PASTE HERE *** 

Delete what is inside the square brackets underneath this line, explicitly,
you will see:

var treeData = [
"something ugly"
];

Replace "something ugly" with what you have copied in the previous step. Save this
as an html file and open, you will see a your desired deduction tree.

Note: The first and last lines of LinearLambdaCalc2 may have to be deleted as well
as a row of equals signs which are somewhere in the middle.
